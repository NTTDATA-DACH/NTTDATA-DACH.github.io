            <p><strong>Unreal Engine</strong> is a powerful tool for creating <strong>real-time interactive experiences</strong>, including virtual reality applications, architectural visualizations and video games.
However, setting up a new project can be a complex task, particularly for teams that are new to the engine.
In this article, I will guide you through the best practices for setting up a new Unreal Engine project that is tailored to your needs and goals.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-define-your-objectives">Step 1: Define Your Objectives</h2>
<p>Before getting into the technical details of setting up a new project in Unreal Engine, it&rsquo;s important to define your project objectives. This will help you choose the appropriate project template, project settings, and tools needed to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>To define your project objectives, you can start by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your target audience?</li>
<li>What platforms will your interactive experience be released on?</li>
<li>What is the scope of your project?</li>
<li>What are your budget and timeline constraints?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a clear understanding of your project objectives, you can move on to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-choose-the-right-unreal-engine-distribution">Step 2: Choose the Right Unreal Engine Distribution</h2>
<p>When setting up a new project in Unreal Engine, one of the first decisions you&rsquo;ll need to make is, which distribution of the engine to use. Unreal Engine is available in several distributions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the right one for your project:</p>
<h3 id="epic-games-launcher-binary">Epic Games Launcher Binary</h3>
<p>The Epic Games Launcher Binary version of Unreal Engine is the easiest and most convenient way to get started with the engine. It&rsquo;s a pre-built version of the engine that can be downloaded and installed from the Epic Games Launcher. This version is ideal for beginners and those who don&rsquo;t need to modify the engine&rsquo;s source code.</p>
<p>The Epic Launcher Binary version also receives regular updates and bug fixes from Epic Games, ensuring that your project stays up-to-date and compatible with the latest features and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="source-code">Source Code</h3>
<p>The Source Code version of Unreal Engine provides access to the engine&rsquo;s complete source code, giving you full control over the engine&rsquo;s functionality and allowing you to make custom modifications to suit your project&rsquo;s specific needs.</p>
<p>This version is ideal for experienced developers who have specific requirements that cannot be met by the Epic Launcher Binary version. However, working with the Source Code version requires a higher level of technical expertise and can be more time-consuming than using the Epic Launcher Binary version. It can also take more than one hour and take up more than 100gb of disk space to compile the engine from source.</p>
<h3 id="oculus-source-code">Oculus Source Code</h3>
<p>The Oculus Source Code version of Unreal Engine is a modified version of the engine that is optimized for virtual reality (VR) development on Oculus devices. The exact difference between the versions can vary over time. At the time of writing, Oculus Source Code is the only distribution capable of soft occlusions in a mixed reality context.</p>
<p>This version is ideal for developers who are specifically targeting Oculus devices and want to take advantage of the engine&rsquo;s VR-specific features. However, it may not be the best choice for projects that target other platforms or don&rsquo;t require VR functionality.</p>
<p>When choosing the right version of Unreal Engine for your project, consider your project&rsquo;s specific requirements, your team&rsquo;s technical expertise, and your development timeline. By choosing the right version, you can ensure that your project is optimized for performance, efficiency, and functionality, and that you can achieve your project objectives with the minimum amount of time and effort.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-choose-the-fitting-project-template">Step 3: Choose the Fitting Project Template</h2>
<p>Unreal Engine offers a variety of project templates to choose from, each tailored to different types of interactive experiences. Choosing the right project template is essential, as it can save you a significant amount of time and effort by providing pre-configured settings and assets that are optimized for your experience type.</p>
<p>To choose the right project template, consider your project objectives and the type of experience you&rsquo;re creating. For example, if you&rsquo;re creating a virtual reality application, choose the &ldquo;Virtual Reality Template&rdquo; to jump-start your project with pre-configured settings and assets optimized for VR experiences. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re creating an architectural visualization, choose the &ldquo;Architectural Visualization Template&rdquo; to get started with settings and assets optimized for architectural projects.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-specify-project-settings">Step 4: Specify Project Settings</h2>
<p>When creating a new project in Unreal Engine, it&rsquo;s essential to specify project settings accurately. Choose a descriptive and meaningful name for your project that accurately reflects its content and purpose. Specify the location where you want to save your project files and choose the appropriate project type (e.g., games, simulations, or architectural visualizations).</p>
<p>Other project settings that you&rsquo;ll need to specify include the supported platforms, input devices, and graphics quality settings. It&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate graphics quality settings for your target platform(s), as this can significantly impact the performance and quality of your experience.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-optimize-performance">Step 5: Optimize Performance</h2>
<p>Optimizing performance is crucial for interactive experience development projects, as it can significantly impact the quality and user experience of your project. Unreal Engine offers a variety of advanced features, such as ray tracing and virtual texturing, that can enhance the quality of your project. However, enabling these features can also impact performance.</p>
<p>To optimize performance, consider the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the appropriate graphics quality settings for your target platform(s)</li>
<li>Use LODs (level of detail) to optimize the rendering of complex objects</li>
<li>Use culling to avoid rendering objects that are outside the player&rsquo;s field of view</li>
<li>Use instancing to optimize the rendering of large numbers of similar objects</li>
<li>Use virtual texturing to efficiently handle large textures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-6-organize-your-project-files">Step 6: Organize Your Project Files</h2>
<p>Organizing your project files is essential for maintaining a clean and efficient workflow throughout your project&rsquo;s development cycle. Here are some tips to help you keep your project files organized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a logical folder structure to organize your assets and code files</li>
<li>Use meaningful names for your assets and code files to make them easy to find</li>
<li>Use source control to track changes and collaborate with your team members</li>
<li>Use Unreal Engine&rsquo;s asset management tools, such as the Asset Browser and Content Browser, to manage your assets efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-7-customize-your-user-interface">Step 7: Customize Your User Interface</h2>
<p>Customizing your user interface (UI) can help you work more efficiently and effectively in Unreal Engine. By default, Unreal Engine&rsquo;s UI may not be optimized for your specific needs, so it&rsquo;s important to customize it to your liking.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine offers a variety of customizable UI elements, such as the toolbar, viewport, and content browser. You can also create custom UI elements using Unreal Engine&rsquo;s UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) system.</p>
<h2 id="step-8-choose-between-c-and-blueprints">Step 8: Choose Between C++ and Blueprints</h2>
<p>Unreal Engine provides two primary ways to implement gameplay logic and functionality: C++ and Blueprints. C++ is a powerful programming language that provides developers with full control over their code, while Blueprints is a visual scripting language that allows non-programmers to create gameplay logic and functionality without writing code.</p>
<p>When choosing between C++ and Blueprints, consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your team&rsquo;s technical expertise: If you have experienced C++ developers on your team, C++ may be the better choice. However, if your team is new to programming or has more experience with visual scripting, Blueprints may be the way to go.</li>
<li>The complexity of your project: If your project requires complex logic or performance-critical functionality, C++ may be necessary. However, for simpler projects or rapid prototyping, Blueprints can be a fast and efficient way to get things done.</li>
<li>Your personal preference: Some developers simply prefer one language over the other, so consider your personal preference when making your decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, you may choose to use a combination of C++ and Blueprints. The performance critical parts of your project could be implemented using C++. They could then expose the functionality with easy to use parameters for designers, who are using Blueprints.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Starting a new project in Unreal Engine can be a daunting task, especially because of the overwhelming number of options available. However, by following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your project is set up for success.</p>
