      <description>There is generally a lot less awareness of Software Supply Chain Security in the contemporary IT landscape and thus its aspects are completely ignored by DevSecOps practices. In this two-part article, I aim to provide an overview of what software supply chain is, what attack vectors you render yourself vulnerable to when not including these aspects in your pipelines and how you can &lt;strong&gt;reduce your attack surface area&lt;/strong&gt; using various tools / frameworks / guidelines like &lt;strong&gt;SLSA&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sigstore&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;in-toto&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SBOM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;TUF&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;OpenSSF&lt;/strong&gt; etc. We will also shed light on how the open source community as a whole is combating this threat.</description>

      <description>Current enterprise software engineering is all about abstraction. We are bending our software in ways that the computer has trouble efficiently computing it. A decade ago we had to write efficient programs, because our hardware was a limiting factor. However, having better hardware is in no excuse to waste precious ressources. With Data-Oriented Design - DOD and Entity Component System - ECS, we can improve performance by up to 100 times!</description>

      <description>Rarely do we find a technology as controversial as blockchain. It seems there are as many blockchain sceptics as blockchain enthusiasts. The sceptics are concerned with unlawful behavior that occurred in public blockchain networks, as well as with extremely high current or past energy consumption of certain public blockchains.</description>

      <description>“You cannot use Docker in our enterprise CI platform, now way! It needs root rights, thus is not secure; forget it!”, said our DevOps Chief some months ago… So we had a problem.</description>

      <title>10 Lessons learnt from large-scale data migration projects</title>

      <description>Data migration is of course only one aspect of system conversion. Usually data migration is performed in conjunction with other conversions like technology or interfaces. Nevertheless, data migration is often the most expensive and confusing part of the conversion project. So let’s revisit the handful of fairly large data migrations I encountered in my professional career and see which lessons can be drawn out of this experience.</description>
