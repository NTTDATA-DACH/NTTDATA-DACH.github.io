      <title>Part 6: Token Validation</title>

      <description>This time we discuss token validation in the context of the Kong Gateway, covering topics such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and Zero-Trust Architecture. The article explains the different types of tokens, the benefits of offline validation, and the various Kong plugins that support token validation. The article notes that architectural trade-offs may be required regarding revocation and fine-grained authorization validation, and concludes that Kong Gateway offers ample options for token validation, including the ability to write custom plugins.</description>

      <title>Part 5: mTLS Header</title>

      <description>Mutual transport layer security (mTLS) with consumer authentication using client certificates at the Kong Gateway plays an important role in building a zero-trust architecture. But perimeter security devices that perform TLS termination, so-called TLS terminating reverse proxies (TTRP), break the automatic mapping of client certificates to Kong consumers. This blog demonstrates mTLS consumer authentication even with preceding TTRPs, without requiring TCP passthrough.</description>

      <title>Part 4: SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Flow for OAuth 2.0</title>
      <link>https://nttdata-dach.github.io/posts/as-konggateway-saml2bearer/</link>

      <description>My last blog provided a solution for implementing an OAuth 2.0-based On-Behalf-Of (delegation) grant flow. This time itâ€™s about implementing a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants. This flow allows OAuth 2.0 clients to obtain access tokens by presenting SAML 2.0 assertions as a form of authentication. This somewhat extended grant flow expands the scope for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different parties with seamless management, all achieved through the API Gateway.</description>

      <title>Part 3: Token Exchange On-Behalf-Of</title>

      <description>In the last blog, I provided a solution on how to overcome the character limit when logging. This time, I would like to show how to implement an OAuth 2.0-based On-Behalf-Of (delegation) grant flow. Such complex token orchestration tasks can be easily handled on the API gateway while ensuring the highest security standards which even make zero-trust architectures possible in the first place.</description>

      <description>In the last blog, I briefly introduced Kong as a sophisticated API gateway product. This time, I will discuss a problem related to logging message size limitation and offer a solution. This problem significantly limits root cause analysis and ultimately solution development.</description>

      <description>Kong Gateway is a lightweight, fast, and flexible API Gateway. It acts as an intermediary between API providers and consumers, enabling them to communicate based on policies. It also provides observability features, allowing to track API usage and performance. Overall it is a convincing and outstanding product which is briefly introduced in the following blog.</description>
