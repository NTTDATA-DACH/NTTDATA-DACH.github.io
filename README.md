# Soon to be technologyblog space

I have created this repository to be the home of the technology blog once finished. Currently we are working on the implementation itself. I wanted to test the publishing process unitl i realized the repository would need to be public (in our github subscription) to be able to server the html content. 

So for now i have kept this repo private. Development of the blog itself will propably happen on s3 including a mechanism to publish things via this repository. 

If you have any question sor concerns contact me (Manuel Schmidt) or Sergej Werbolowski either direct or via the Teams Chat: "NTT EMEA Github Team" @  https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ac015ac8bee664d91a9cda795d999cfbe%40thread.tacv2/Allgemein?groupId=5c2b4cdf-3b33-4ccd-bce2-29cf58580c17&tenantId=d6c66915-bd01-45b2-aa93-0b3f917eb2ec
