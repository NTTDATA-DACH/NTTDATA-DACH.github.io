      <description>Let’s continue to automate the release process with versioning, GitHub releases, and promotion using Fastlane and GitHub Actions. This time we focus on setting up a new workflow that bumps the version, creates a new tag, and pushes the changes to the repository. The article also covers creating a new release with generated release notes from the commit messages and merged branches since the last tag. Finally, we will promote a release from the internal track or TestFlight to the production track in the PlayStore and AppStore respectively. All in all, this is an essential guide to streamlining the release process for your Flutter app.</description>

      <description>Kafka Connect, a solution from Confluent for transferring data to and from Kafka, provides a high-performance and scalable option for connecting to over 80 different data sources, including databases, messaging systems, REST interfaces, and cloud storage. Using Kafka Connect can save a lot of time and effort, especially if scalability and security are important to your project. To use Connect, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to understand the basic architecture, which includes Workers, Tasks and Connectors  as well as how to configure them.</description>

      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/RD-HazelcastMetricsViaPrometheus/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>A step-by-step guide on how to collect Hazelcast metrics via Prometheus. The tutorial is aimed at those who are running a customized Hazelcast microservice, rather than the full-blown zip-file/dockers. The guide covers all the necessary steps, from adding the Prometheus dependency to Java code configuration, updating application YAML and Dockerfile, to updating the ServiceMonitor. The article also offers helpful hints and sources for further reading.</description>

      <description>After showing how to get an OpenTelemetry Collector to support Prometheus CRDs as scrape targets, we discover how to integrate another well-known approach to mark workloads as scrape targets. Now, we focus on annotation-based scraping - what is it, when would we want to use it and how can we integrate it in our OpenTelemetry stack? In this article, we provide answers to all these questions, and more.</description>

      <title>Kong - The Gateway without Limitations - Part 7: Token Cloning</title>
      <link>https://nttdata-dach.github.io/posts/as-konggateway-tokencloning/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/AS-KongGateway-TokenCloning/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>Building on the previous post, we discuss an architectural pattern for token handling called &amp;rsquo;therapeutic token cloning&amp;rsquo;, which is particularly effective in environments that use multiple identity and access management products. The pattern involves duplicating, correcting, and then re-signing access tokens to make them functional and more secure. This article details the steps involved in the token cloning process, as well as the pros and cons of this approach.</description>

      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/AS-KongGateway-TokenValidation/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>This time we discuss token validation in the context of the Kong Gateway, covering topics such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and Zero-Trust Architecture. The article explains the different types of tokens, the benefits of offline validation, and the various Kong plugins that support token validation. The article notes that architectural trade-offs may be required regarding revocation and fine-grained authorization validation, and concludes that Kong Gateway offers ample options for token validation, including the ability to write custom plugins.</description>

      <description>Having explained the technical implementation of the monitoring stack in our latest blog post, this article focuses on replacing Prometheus with OpenTelemetry Collector to decouple scraping from the storage and query mechanisms. The OpenTelemetry Collector uses various building blocks to construct the telemetry pipeline and requires enabling of the target allocator. Guiding you through this process we provide various practical tips, including processor ordering and horizontal autoscaling.&amp;quot;</description>

      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/NF-EN-DataMeshAsAnElementOfDataStrategy/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>In this article we discuss the challenges of storing vast amounts of data to become a value-driven organization and introduce data mesh, an innovative technology that addresses these challenges. We outline the four principles of data mesh and provide a step-by-step framework for implementing the architecture. The article also gives an example of data mesh implementation using serverless tools on AWS and emphasizes that the selection between data mesh and traditional data architectures depends on the specific needs, capabilities, and goals of the business.</description>

      <title>Kong - The Gateway without Limitations - Part 5: mTLS Header</title>
      <link>https://nttdata-dach.github.io/posts/as-konggateway-mtls_header/</link>

      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/AS-KongGateway-mTLS_Header/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>Mutual transport layer security (mTLS) with consumer authentication using client certificates at the Kong Gateway plays an important role in building a zero-trust architecture. But perimeter security devices that perform TLS termination, so-called TLS terminating reverse proxies (TTRP), break the automatic mapping of client certificates to Kong consumers. This blog demonstrates mTLS consumer authentication even with preceding TTRPs, without requiring TCP passthrough.</description>

      <title>Kong - The Gateway without Limitations - Part 4: SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Flow for OAuth 2.0</title>
      <link>https://nttdata-dach.github.io/posts/as-konggateway-saml2bearer/</link>

      <guid>https://nttdata-dach.github.io//posts/img/AS-KongGateway-Saml2Bearer/title-image.jpg</guid>
      <description>My last blog provided a solution for implementing an OAuth 2.0-based On-Behalf-Of (delegation) grant flow. This time it’s about implementing a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants. This flow allows OAuth 2.0 clients to obtain access tokens by presenting SAML 2.0 assertions as a form of authentication. This somewhat extended grant flow expands the scope for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different parties with seamless management, all achieved through the API Gateway.</description>

      <description>With this blog post, we kick off a series on evolving our Kubernetes metrics stack. Our journey to replace Prometheus with an OpenTelemetry solution begins with an introduction OpenTelemetry and why we see it as a valid alternative to our current implementation. After explaining the main parts of the OpenTelemetry project and briefly reviewing its history, we discuss the pros and cons. After reading this, you will be able to follow along our hands-on and deep-tech posts on how we optimize our metrics stack.</description>

      <description>In the last blog, I provided a solution on how to overcome the character limit when logging. This time, I would like to show how to implement an OAuth 2.0-based On-Behalf-Of (delegation) grant flow. Such complex token orchestration tasks can be easily handled on the API gateway while ensuring the highest security standards which even make zero-trust architectures possible in the first place.</description>
