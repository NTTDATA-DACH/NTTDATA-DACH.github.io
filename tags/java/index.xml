      <description>As a developer in an agile world it becomes quite normal to be involved in more than one activity (projects, trainings and some research) at a  time. Each of these activities may require a specific setup of development environments in terms of programming languages, compiler and library versions. Installing and maintaining all this with a classical approach is error-prone and requires a lot of effort. Using task-specific virtual machines would solve the problem, but it consumes a lot of resources and causes a lot of maintenance as well, because one also needs to keep VM&amp;rsquo;s operating system up to date. This article shows, how DevContainers can help you create and maintain reproducible development environments leveraging the benefits of modern container technology.</description>
